Dependency injection is a great concept where developers can make a great use of. It's a way of holding object dependencies for easier to test & maintain the code. Since we are always building maintainable products with glim, it would provide solutions for much more complex systems.

Currently, it's the weakest part of glim. The 0.10.x releases will provide a much more extensive use of DI in glim. There is only a simple, non-complete ioc container to make use of objects to be generated and passed through other classes with only a key value dict.
